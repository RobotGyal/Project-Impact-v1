Dates 3/16-3/25

Aleia Knight


**Project Name:** 
Project Impact


**Is your project New or Old?**
It is a old and incomplete project.

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo


## Description
Right now I have the entire dataset that I need. I have worked with some of the fields and worked with visualizing a few aspects. The data set is about 46,000 rows so working with this larger set will be good practice going forward. I want to be able to cleanly display this data so and use what I've found along the analysis to make and display certain results and predictions. 


## Challenges I Anticipate
    Getting all geolocations translated to physical locations
    Wasting time with long calculations running on a large dataset
    Switching between different tools and resources (Jupyter, DS libraries, Javascript, Python, Django,...)


## Skateboard
Get data cleaned and displayed on a webpage.

## Bike
Do basic visualizations (histograms, bar graphs, etc) and get optimize to reduce time. Work with geolocation libraries to help with displaying latitude and longitude.

## Car
Get higher level visualizations using D3 library and other data visualization libraries.



## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1

1. Find out ways to clean data
1. Get datasets, visualizations, etc. display-able on a website
1. Get all geolocations translated to the actual physical locations
