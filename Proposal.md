## Description
To create a tool for users to be able to see all meteors in a certain radius of the area and to work with the NASA Meteorite dataset. 

Right now I have the entire dataset that I need. I have worked with some of the fields and worked with visualizing a few aspects. The data set is about 46,000 rows so working with this larger set will be good practice going forward. I want to be able to cleanly display this data so and use what I've found along the analysis to make and display certain results and predictions. 


## Challenges I Anticipate
* Getting all geolocations translated to physical locations
* Wasting time with long calculations running on a large dataset
* Switching between different tools and resources (Jupyter, DS libraries, Javascript, Python, Django,...)


## Skateboard
Get data cleaned and displayed on a webpage.

## Bike
Do basic visualizations (histograms, bar graphs, etc.) and get optimize to reduce time. Work with geolocation libraries to help with displaying latitude and longitude and make searchable. 

## Car
Use URL routing to get back results from the dataset
Example:
* .../location -> returns all meteors at that location
* .../location/50 -> returns all meteors in the given radius of the location


## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Clean Data
2. Get datasets, visualizations, etc. display-able on a website
3. Get all geolocations translated to the actual physical locations
4. Get data into a database
5. Make latitude, longitude, and geolocations indexable
