## Description
Right now I have the entire dataset that I need. I have worked with some of the fields and worked with visualizing a few aspects. The data set is about 46,000 rows so working with this larger set will be good practice going forward. 




## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**



## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 




## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**
